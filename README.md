# Living With the Letter  
### *A fugitive companion, not a guide*

**We invite you to perform this letter in spaces where letters don’t belong.**  
*Staff meetings. Classrooms. Funding panels. Retreats that smell like linear strategies.*  
Let it interrupt the agenda by interrupting the method. Let it disturb the neat architecture of thought — that *“Cartesian anxiety”*, the artificial divide between thinking and feeling, between the body and the mind *(Varela et al., 1991, p. 133).*

> **Remember:** *Improvisation is not a lack of method.*  
> It is a commitment to being with, to staying present to the moment,  
> to the voices in the room, to what needs to be said and felt.

Bring this letter to spaces of **co-creation**:  
**Conferences. Encampments. Gatherings where people risk tenderness in public.**  
Read it on a sidewalk. In a pub. In the pause between chants. Let it be protest.

Let the letter take on new textures:  
*Spoken in unfamiliar tongues. Read with shaking hands. Interrupted by laughter, silence — and also with dissent.*  
The letter will not stay still.

It wasn’t meant to.  
It was never a script or a toolkit.  
It carries **love** and **grief**.  
And something else too: *a kind of love that refuses to give up.*

The letter breathes.  
It belongs to no one — and yet, it **calls out for your company**.

It is part of a constellation, a scattering of voices, gestures, interruptions,  
and **we invite you to scatter more**.

Like a *mad-lib* or a *ritual*, it invites your playfulness, and asks you to **break it**:  
Say what we didn’t say.  
Refuse what we could not.  
*Continue its disobedience.*

To co-create, remix, and share your adaptations, we have a **GitHub repository**,  
where versions of the letter can live collectively — like open-source code.

You are welcome to **upload your adaptations**, your readings, your voices.

---

Let the letter be **forked**, **remixed**, **spoken in new rhythms**, **broken**, and **made again**.  
Not owned.  
Let it be **unfinished**.  
Let it be **alive**.
